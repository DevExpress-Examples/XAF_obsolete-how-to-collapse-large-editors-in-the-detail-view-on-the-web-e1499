<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to collapse large editors in the detail view</h1>
<p>Sometimes when your detail view contains a lot of editors, it is necessary to effectively use the space on the page. For example, usually editors in which collection properties are shown take a lot of space. You can reduce the space if you provide the capability to collapse large editors.
In this example, I show how to put a large editor into the ASPxNavBar (ms-help://DevExpress.AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxNavBarASPxNavBartopic.htm) control that can expand/collapse its groups.
