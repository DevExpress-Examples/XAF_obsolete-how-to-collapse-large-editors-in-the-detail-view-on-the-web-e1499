' How to collapse large editors in the detail view
' 
' Sometimes when your detail view contains a lot of editors, it is necessary to
' effectively use the space on the page. For example, usually editors in which
' collection properties are shown take a lot of space. You can reduce the space if
' you provide the capability to collapse large editors.
' In this example, I show
' how to put a large editor into the ASPxNavBar
' (ms-help://DevExpress.AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxNavBarASPxNavBartopic.htm)
' control that can expand/collapse its groups.
